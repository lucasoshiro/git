NAME
----
git-repo-info - Retrieve information about a repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
[synopsis]
git repo-info

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Retrieve information about the current repository in a machine-readable format.

`git repo-info` will be the primary tool to query repository-specific
information, which currently can also be done by calling `git rev-parse` (see
linkgit:git-rev-parse[1]). `git repo-info` doesn't query information unrelated
to the current repository or that is already retrieved by a specialized command,
for example, `git config` (see linkgit:git-config[1]) or `git var` (see
linkgit:git-var[1]).

THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. THE BEHAVIOR MAY CHANGE.

OPTIONS
-------

`<key>`::
Key of the value that will be retrieved. It should be in the format
`<category>.<field>`. See the "CATEGORIES AND FIELDS" section below.

CATEGORIES AND FIELDS
---------------------

The set of data that `git repo-info` can return is divided into
categories. Each category is composed by one or more fields.
