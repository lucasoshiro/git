git-repo(1)
===========

NAME
----
git-repo - Retrieve information about a repository

SYNOPSIS
--------
[synopsis]
git repo info [<key>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Retrieve information about the current repository in a machine-readable format.

`git repo` will be the primary tool to query repository-specific information,
such as metadata that currently can also be done by calling `git rev-parse` (see
linkgit:git-rev-parse[1]). `git repo` doesn't query information unrelated to the
current repository or that is already retrieved by a specialized command, for
example, `git config` (see linkgit:git-config[1]) or `git var` (see
linkgit:git-var[1]).

This command returns the retrieved data following a null-terminated format with
this syntax:
+
----------------
key1<LF>value1<NUL>
key2<LF>value2<NUL>
...
----------------
+
THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. THE BEHAVIOR MAY CHANGE.

COMMANDS
--------
info [<key>...]::
	Retrieve metadata-related information about the current repository. Only
	the requested data will be returned based on their keys (see "INFO KEYS"
	section below).

INFO KEYS
---------

The set of data that `git repo` can return is grouped into the following
categories:

`references`::
Reference-related data:
* `format`: the reference storage format, either `files` or `reftable`.
