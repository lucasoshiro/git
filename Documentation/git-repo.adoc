DESCRIPTION
-----------
Retrieve information about the repository.

THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. THE BEHAVIOR MAY CHANGE.

COMMANDS
--------
`info [<key>...]`::
	Retrieve metadata-related information about the current repository. Only
	the requested data will be returned based on their keys (see "INFO KEYS"
	section below).
+
The returned data is lexicographically sorted by the keys.
+
The output format consists of key-value pairs one per line using the `=`
character as the delimiter between the key and the value. Values containing
"unusual" characters are quoted as explained for the configuration variable
`core.quotePath` (see linkgit:git-config[1]). This is the default.

INFO KEYS
---------

In order to obtain a set of values from `git repo info`, you should provide
the keys that identify them. Here's a list of the available keys and the
values that they return:

`layout.bare`::
`true` if this is a bare repository, otherwise `false`.

`references.format`::
The reference storage format. The valid values are:
