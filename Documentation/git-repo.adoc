COMMANDS
--------
info [--format=<format>] [<key>...]::
	Retrieve metadata-related information about the current repository. Only
	the requested data will be returned based on their keys (see "INFO KEYS"
	section below).
+
The output format can be chosen through the flag `--format`. Two formats are
supported:
+
* `keyvalue`: output key-value pairs one per line using the `=` character as
the delimiter between the key and the value. This is the default.

* `null`: similar to `keyvalue`, but using a newline character as the delimiter
between the key and the value and using a null character after each value.
This format is better suited for being parsed by another applications than
`keyvalue`.

categories:

`references`::
Reference-related data:
* `format`: the reference storage format

`layout`::
